# Intrusion-Detection-in-IOT-using-CNN

## Introduction and Overview

This repository contains the research work conducted as part of an MTech program, focusing on the detection and classification of malicious intrusions in smart vehicles.

## Data Collection

The data used in this project was obtained from the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port of the vehicles. 

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data was converted from a textual format to a visual format, making it suitable for input into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Model Training

The CNN model was trained on labeled data, which was classified into five distinct classes.

## Model Testing

The model was subsequently tested on the remaining 80% of the data, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.9%.

## Publication

The research work has been published on IEEE. The paper, titled "Detection and Classification of Anomalies in Internet of Vehicles using Convolutional Neural Networks", provides a comprehensive overview of the research and its findings.

## Research Goals

The research aims to enhance the security and safety of smart vehicles by detecting and classifying attacks that compromise their integrity. The types of attacks included in this research work for classification are Denial of Service Attack (DoS), Spoofing (RPM Spoof, Gear Spoof), and Fuzzy Attack. The ultimate goal of the research is to design a solution that enhances system security, preserves privacy, and increases user trust.
